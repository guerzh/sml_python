Write a function with the signature `two_in_a_row(queue)` that returns `True` if a list contains the same name twice in a row, and `False` otherwise. For example, `two_in_a_row([\"Mike G.\", \"Alice C.\", \"Bob A.\", \"Bob A.\", \"Mary C.\"])` should return `True`, since the string `\"Bob A.\"` appears twice in a row, but `two_in_a_row([\"Sam A.\", \"Dorothy Z.\"])` should return `False`."
